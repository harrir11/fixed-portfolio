# React-portfolio

I’m Rebecca Harris, a full-stack developer who loves building projects end-to-end—from shaping backend APIs to designing clean, interactive frontends. My background is in backend engineering, where I worked with Python, Java, SQL, and AWS to build secure, distributed systems in an enterprise environment. Over time, I’ve expanded into frontend work with React, Next.js, and Tailwind, and I enjoy the creativity that comes with turning raw data into intuitive interfaces.
Outside of work, I create projects that blend tech with curiosity—like an interactive map that tracks egg prices globally, or a Reddit scraper that analyzes sentiment over time. These projects keep me learning, experimenting, and connecting the dots between data, design, and storytelling.
What drives me is building tools that are not only technically solid but also meaningful and responsible. I’m excited to keep growing as a developer while contributing to systems that are transparent, useful, and people-centered.
